<h1>Baby, just lay there, don't you move. 
And I will lay right here, watchin' you.
I wonder if you know how much I love just
  Having you in my life.</h1>

<h1 style="display: none">'Cause you're my favorite thing to hold, 
When the world is running 'round. 
  You're my favorite place to hide....</h1>
